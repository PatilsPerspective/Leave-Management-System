# Leave Management System

# Objectives:
i. Implement an automated leave management system.<br>
ii. Ensure transparency and visibility.<br>
iii. Accurate leave records and calculations.<br>
iv. Reduce fake approval using signatures.<br>

# Problem Statement:
The existing leave management system in our college is outdated and inefficient, leading to numerous challenges and difficulties for both students and the faculty. The current system heavily relies on manual processes and paper-based forms, resulting in errors, delays, and a lack of transparency. This outdated system not only hampers productivity but also creates frustration among students and faculty personnel.

# Solution:
The Leave Management System project for students aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient platform for managing and processing leave requests. The Leave Management System is very useful for colleges to maintain the leave records of their students. By implementing this system, students will be able to submit leave requests, track their approval status, and receive timely updates. This system promotes transparency, reduces paperwork, and ensures a smooth and organized leave management experience for all stakeholders involved.

An overview of how a typical leave management system functions is provided below:<br>
Student asks for time off: Students may submit requests for leave using the system's online portal or application. They offer information such as the type of leave (such as casual leave, sick leave, or duty leave), the start and end dates, and any applicable justifications. Submission of a leave request: After a student submits a leave request, the system logs the information and submits an application to the HOD for approval.
